<h3><i>
	Deuteronomy 28:20-22 20The LORD will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him. <br>
	21The LORD will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess. 22The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish.</i><br><br></h3>


<h2>The above verse have come true to the people of this world.  This Covid and its related problem will only become intense till people understand their mistake. <br><br></h2>


<h3><i>Revelation 16:5 5Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: "You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were;<br>

Revelation 16:8-9 8The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire.<br>
 9They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.<br><br></i></h3>

 <h2>God is in control, but people are still complaining about the situation instead of rectifying their mistake. They must only thank God for all these judgement on mankind.  The inequity of the land must be measured and justice should be rendered,  until then situation may become bad.  <br><br></h2>


<h3><i>Jonah 3:5-10 5The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. <br>

6When Jonah's warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust.<br>

  7This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh: "By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. <br>

8But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. <br>

9Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.‚Äù <br>

10When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened.<br><br></i></h3>


<h2>People must do the above to stop any disaster from God. What I say may appear obsolete to many but anything can happen anytime. Many people will not realise this truth because the worst has not happened yet but imagine if the food supply to the city is cut due to war or anything else. People must understand this truth before its late.</h2>
