	<h2>Isaiah 49:1-2  Before I was born the LORD called me; from my mother's womb he has spoken my name. <br>
	2 He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.<br><br>

	Hi YBK, I can see your interest in kingdoms, Kings, Leaders, history, weapons, army, priesthood, temples. These are the areas where all rulers show interest. Today the weapons you have to use is your words. It is time for you to train yourself for politics. You may start to work on the strategy to conquer Erode constituency. <br><br>

Dont confuse yourself about God and ideology. God wants justice and he is within you. Centurions are with you.<br><br>

Vote for YBK- Erode Constituency.</h2>  <br>
